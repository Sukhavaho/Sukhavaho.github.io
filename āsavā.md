**Āsavā** (Pāli: **āsava**), often translated as "cankers," "influxes," or "outflows," are deep-rooted mental defilements in Theravāda Buddhism. They are considered the most subtle and pervasive impurities that sustain the cycle of samsāra (birth, death, and rebirth). Āsavā represent the underlying tendencies or latent predispositions that continuously flow into the mind, giving rise to more immediate defilements (kilesā) like greed, hatred, and delusion.

### **Types of Āsavā:**

1. **Kāmāsava**: The influx of sensual desire, leading to attachment to sensory pleasures.
2. **Bhavāsava**: The influx of becoming or desire for existence, manifesting as attachment to life and the fear of non-existence.
3. **Diṭṭhāsava**: The influx of views, particularly wrong or fixed views, which distort perception and understanding of reality.
4. **Avijjāsava**: The influx of ignorance or delusion, which is the fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of reality, including the Four Noble Truths and the nature of self.

### **Key Points:**

- **Fundamental Role**: Āsavā are the deepest sources of mental and spiritual pollution, giving rise to all other defilements. They are the underlying forces that keep beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth.
  
- **Eradication**: The complete eradication of āsavā is a hallmark of **arahantship**, the final stage of enlightenment in Theravāda Buddhism. Only an arahant has completely extinguished these deep-seated influxes, achieving liberation from samsāra.

- **Importance**: Understanding and working to weaken āsavā is crucial on the path to liberation. While ordinary practitioners may deal with kilesā on a day-to-day basis, the complete cessation of āsavā marks the culmination of the spiritual path.

Āsavā are thus fundamental to Buddhist psychology and practice, representing the core defilements that must be fully uprooted to achieve Nibbāna, the cessation of all suffering and rebirth.
