The Pāli word **kilesā** is the plural form of **kilesa**, which means "defilement" or "mental impurity." 

### **Grammar Breakdown:**
- **Kilesā** (plural nominative form)
  - **kilesa**: noun, masculine gender, singular form
  - **kilesā**: plural nominative form

In Pāli, nouns change their form based on number (singular or plural) and case (such as nominative, accusative, etc.). The word **kilesa** in its plural nominative form becomes **kilesā**, meaning "defilements" or "impurities" in the context of mental defilements.

### **Usage:**
In Buddhist texts, **kilesā** refers to the various mental defilements or afflictions that obstruct the mind and lead to suffering. These include greed, hatred, delusion, and other related unwholesome states that hinder spiritual progress.


### **Summary of Kilesā:**

**Kilesā** are mental defilements or impurities that obscure the mind and lead to unwholesome actions, suffering, and the continuation of the cycle of rebirth (samsāra). They are the fundamental roots of all unwholesome states and are obstacles to the attainment of Nibbāna. The primary kilesā are typically grouped into three root defilements:

1. **Lobha** (Greed or Attachment): The craving for sensual pleasures, material goods, and existence.
2. **Dosa** (Hatred or Aversion): The tendency to react with anger, ill-will, or hostility.
3. **Moha** (Delusion or Ignorance): The misperception of reality, not seeing things as they truly are, and misunderstanding the nature of existence.

Beyond these three, there are numerous other kilesā that arise as derivatives or specific manifestations, such as pride (māna), wrong view (diṭṭhi), jealousy (issā), and restlessness (uddhacca).

### **References in the Pāli Canon:**

The kilesā are discussed in various places throughout the Pāli Canon. Some of the key references where they are elaborated upon in detail include:

1. **Dhammasaṅgaṇī (Buddhist Psychological Ethics)** in the **Abhidhamma Piṭaka**:
   - This text is part of the **Abhidhamma**, the third "basket" of the Pāli Canon, which deals with detailed philosophical and psychological analysis. The Dhammasaṅgaṇī offers an extensive classification of mental states, including an exhaustive list and analysis of various kilesā.

2. **Vibhanga Sutta (MN 139)** in the **Majjhima Nikāya**:
   - This sutta explains the nature of various defilements, including how they arise and how they can be abandoned.

3. **Saṅgīti Sutta (DN 33)** in the **Dīgha Nikāya**:
   - The Saṅgīti Sutta provides a numerical listing of various aspects of the Dhamma, including defilements. It includes a detailed enumeration of kilesā.

4. **Nivāraṇa Sutta (SN 46.40)** in the **Saṃyutta Nikāya**:
   - This sutta discusses the five hindrances (nīvaraṇas), which are closely related to the kilesā and obstruct meditation and mental clarity.

5. **Visuddhimagga (The Path of Purification)** by Buddhaghosa:
   - Although not part of the Canon, this 5th-century Theravāda commentary extensively discusses the nature of kilesā, especially in the section on purification of mind (*Cittavisuddhi*). The Visuddhimagga is a critical text for understanding the traditional Theravāda view on kilesā.

These references provide detailed discussions on the nature, origin, and methods for overcoming kilesā within the framework of Theravāda Buddhism. Understanding and eradicating these defilements is central to the Buddhist path, as they are the primary obstacles to achieving enlightenment.
