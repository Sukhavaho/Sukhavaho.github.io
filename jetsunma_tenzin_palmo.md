# Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo's Biography:
Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo was born Diane Perry in England in 1943. 
Inspired by Buddhism from a young age, she traveled to India in 1964 and was ordained as one of the first Western Tibetan Buddhist nuns by His Holiness the 16th Karmapa and training with the 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche. 
She subsequently undertook a strict 12-year meditation retreat in a remote Himalayan cave. 
Returning from retreat in 1988, she began teaching internationally at the request of her late teacher. 
In the decade that followed, honoring his wish to establish a nunnery, she founded Dongyu Gatsal Ling, which now houses over 100 nuns. 
Recognized for her spiritual accomplishments, she received the title of Jetsunma - "Venerable Master" - from the Drukpa Kagyu Head in 2008 and continues working to promote female monasticism in Buddhism.
