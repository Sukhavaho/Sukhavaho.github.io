MN 27: Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta (The Shorter Discourse on the Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint)

1. Context and Audience

The Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta is found in the Majjhima Nikāya, in the section devoted to discourses that provide teachings foundational to the practice of the Dhamma. This sutta is delivered by the Buddha to a group of brahmins and others who were either skeptical of or curious about the Buddha’s teachings. The context highlights how the Buddha skillfully uses a simile (the elephant’s footprint) to explain the vastness and all-encompassing nature of his teaching.

2. Structure of the Sutta

The sutta can be divided into three main sections:
	1.	The Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint:
	•	The Buddha compares the footprint of an elephant, which can contain all smaller animal footprints, to the Four Noble Truths, which encompass all aspects of the Dhamma. This sets the theme for the discourse: the comprehensiveness and essential nature of the Four Noble Truths.
	2.	Detailed Steps of the Path:
	•	The Buddha explains the gradual training (anupubbikathā), which progresses through:
	•	Generosity (dāna),
	•	Virtue (sīla),
	•	Renunciation (nekkhamma),
	•	The perils of sensuality (kāmādīnava),
	•	The benefit of renunciation.
	•	This leads to the full development of the Noble Eightfold Path and the understanding of the Four Noble Truths.
	3.	Attainment of Liberation:
	•	The culmination of the practice is the attainment of arahantship, characterized by the destruction of the taints (āsava-khaya).

3. Key Messages
	1.	Gradual Training:
	•	The Buddha emphasizes a progressive approach to the spiritual path. He does not rush straight into advanced doctrines but builds a strong foundation by teaching generosity, ethics, and renunciation before introducing deeper meditative and contemplative practices.
	2.	Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint:
	•	The teaching that the Four Noble Truths subsume all aspects of the Dhamma is central to this sutta. Just as the footprint of an elephant contains the footprints of all smaller animals, the Four Noble Truths encapsulate the entire path to liberation.
	3.	Integration of Practice:
	•	The path integrates conduct (sīla), meditation (samādhi), and wisdom (paññā). This holistic view of practice reinforces the necessity of balancing morality, concentration, and insight.
	4.	Cessation of the Taints (āsavakkhaya):
	•	The ultimate goal of the path is the eradication of defilements (the three āsavas: sensual desire, becoming, and ignorance). This marks the final liberation from suffering.
	5.	Skillful Pedagogy:
	•	The Buddha tailors his teachings to the audience’s capacity to understand. By starting with accessible and relatable ideas (e.g., generosity), he paves the way for the acceptance of deeper, more profound teachings.

4. Unusual Aspects of This Sutta
	•	Use of Gradual Instruction:
	•	This is one of the clearest examples of the Buddha’s pedagogical method of starting with simpler topics before advancing to more profound teachings. This is a hallmark of his teaching style and is especially emphasized in this discourse.
	•	Elephant Footprint Simile:
	•	While similes and metaphors are common in the Buddha’s teachings, this particular simile is striking because it encapsulates the structure of the sutta itself—broad themes narrowing into specific applications.

5. Corresponding Commentaries

The commentary (Papañcasūdanī) explains this sutta in detail, offering insights into the various elements:
	•	Simile of the Footprint:
	•	The commentary expands on the appropriateness of the elephant’s footprint as a metaphor for the Four Noble Truths and the gradual training.
	•	Gradual Training:
	•	The commentary highlights how the progression from generosity to virtue, renunciation, and eventually the Noble Eightfold Path mirrors the spiritual development of practitioners.
	•	Arahantship:
	•	The commentary elaborates on āsava-khaya, explaining the three taints and how they are eradicated through the cultivation of insight (vipassanā).
