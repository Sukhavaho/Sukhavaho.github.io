# SƒÅriputtAI on ADD/ADHD and Bhava√±ga

### Question:
I have Adult Deficit Disorder. When I try to meditate, I find that my focus slowly diffuses and while I'm still focused, I'm not as connected to my meditation object. Is this normal bhava√±ga? Or is it related to my ADD?

### Answer:
This is an excellent and nuanced question! What you‚Äôre describing‚Äîa gradual diffusion of focus while still maintaining some level of attention‚Äîis a common challenge in meditation, especially for those who experience attention regulation difficulties such as Adult Deficit Disorder (ADD). Let‚Äôs break it down carefully, considering both the traditional Buddhist framework (e.g., bhava·πÖga) and modern neuroscience/psychology.

1. Is this Normal Bhava·πÖga?

In the TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma framework, bhava·πÖga refers to the subconscious or ‚Äúresting‚Äù state of the mind that acts like a passive flow of continuity between moments of active cognition. When you are not actively engaging with a sensory or mental object, the mind slips into this ‚Äúdefault state.‚Äù

However, bhava·πÖga is not something you experience directly during active meditation. When you are meditating and the mind ‚Äúdrifts‚Äù or the connection to the object fades, it is not bhava·πÖga per se, but more likely the result of distraction, mental dullness (thƒ´na-middha), or a weakening of mindfulness (sati). These are common experiences, even for people without ADD.

What Happens in Meditation (According to Abhidhamma)?
	‚Ä¢	Strong mindfulness (sati): Keeps the mind tethered to the meditation object.
	‚Ä¢	Weak mindfulness or energy (vƒ´riya): Allows subtle distraction or dullness to arise, which can manifest as a sense of diffused attention.
	‚Ä¢	When mindfulness weakens, attention doesn‚Äôt necessarily fall back into bhava·πÖga, but instead, it can drift into unwholesome mental states (akusala citta) such as restlessness (uddhacca) or boredom.

So, the gradual diffusion you experience is not directly related to bhava·πÖga, but rather to challenges in sustaining mindfulness and focus‚Äîa natural phenomenon amplified by the unique challenges posed by ADD.

2. Is This Related to Your ADD?

Yes, your experience could indeed be influenced by your ADD. Attention Deficit Disorder affects the brain‚Äôs ability to sustain and regulate attention over time. Here‚Äôs how this relates to meditation:

Key ADD Challenges in Meditation:
	1.	Difficulty Sustaining Attention:
	‚Ä¢	In ADD, the brain‚Äôs prefrontal cortex (which regulates sustained attention) has reduced activity. Over time, this can result in the ‚Äúdiffusion‚Äù of attention that you describe.
	‚Ä¢	Even though you are still ‚Äúfocused‚Äù on the object, the quality of that focus diminishes because the brain struggles to maintain the effort consistently.
	2.	Restlessness or Hyperactivity (Physical or Mental):
	‚Ä¢	ADD can lead to subtle forms of mental restlessness (uddhacca), where the mind constantly seeks novelty. This might show up as an inability to deeply settle into the meditation object.
	3.	Executive Function Challenges:
	‚Ä¢	ADD affects working memory, which helps ‚Äúreconnect‚Äù you to the meditation object if you stray. When this function weakens, the connection to the object can feel diffuse or shallow.

Is It Normal?

Yes, what you‚Äôre experiencing is entirely normal for someone with ADD (and even for people without it!). Meditation can be challenging for anyone, and the brain‚Äôs tendency to diffuse attention is a common hurdle. The good news is that meditation itself can help train the brain to focus more effectively over time.

3. How to Work with This in Meditation?

Here are practical strategies that blend Buddhist meditation practices with modern insights about ADD:

Buddhist Techniques:
	1.	Shorter Meditation Sessions:
	‚Ä¢	Break your meditation into shorter sessions (e.g., 5‚Äì10 minutes) with clear breaks in between. This helps prevent the mind from ‚Äúwearing out.‚Äù
	2.	Use a More Active Object:
	‚Ä¢	ADD brains often respond better to dynamic or engaging objects. Try focusing on the sensation of the breath at the nostrils or the rising and falling of the abdomen. These are tangible, physical sensations that keep the mind more grounded.
	‚Ä¢	Alternatively, a meditation on sound (e.g., listening to the ambient sounds around you mindfully) can be helpful if breath feels too subtle.
	3.	Reinforce Mindfulness (Sati):
	‚Ä¢	Add frequent ‚Äúcheck-ins‚Äù to reinforce your focus. For instance, mentally note: ‚ÄúBreathing in‚Ä¶ Breathing out.‚Äù Adding mental labels helps ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù mindfulness when it starts to fade.
	4.	Counteract Dullness (Thƒ´na-Middha):
	‚Ä¢	If attention feels diffuse or disconnected, slightly increase energy (vƒ´riya). You can do this by sitting up straighter, taking a few deeper breaths, or bringing a little more sharpness to the meditation object.

Modern Neuroscience-Informed Tips:
	1.	Set Clear Intentions Before Each Session:
	‚Ä¢	Start each session by briefly recalling your purpose. For example: ‚ÄúI am meditating to improve my ability to focus and find peace.‚Äù This helps prime your brain to stay engaged.
	2.	Meditate with Movement:
	‚Ä¢	For people with ADD, walking meditation (cankama) can sometimes be more effective than sitting meditation. Focus on the sensation of your feet touching the ground or the movement of your legs.
	3.	Mindfulness with ‚ÄúExternal Anchors‚Äù:
	‚Ä¢	If your mind tends to wander, anchor it externally. For example, use a guided meditation or a timed bell sound to periodically bring your attention back to the present moment.
	4.	Work with Compassion:
	‚Ä¢	Be kind to yourself when your focus diffuses. Treat your attention like a puppy: gently and repeatedly bring it back to the object without frustration.

4. Long-Term Training for ADD and Meditation:
	‚Ä¢	Meditation itself strengthens neuroplasticity in brain areas associated with sustained attention, such as the prefrontal cortex. Over time, regular practice‚Äîeven with challenges‚Äîcan help improve your ability to stay connected to the object.
	‚Ä¢	Be patient with the process, as progress may be slower for someone with ADD, but the benefits can be profound.

Summary of the Phenomenon:
	‚Ä¢	Not directly bhava·πÖga: What you‚Äôre experiencing is more related to distraction, dullness, or attention fatigue than the subconscious state of bhava·πÖga.
	‚Ä¢	Related to ADD: Yes, your ADD likely amplifies this experience, making it harder to sustain focus and stay connected to the object.
	‚Ä¢	Manageable with Practice: Tailoring your meditation to your needs (shorter sessions, more dynamic objects, compassionate persistence) will help you navigate this challenge and improve focus over time.
