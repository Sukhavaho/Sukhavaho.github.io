# [The Precepts](https://sukhavaho.github.io/decoder)

In early and Theravada Buddhism, there are several different sets of precepts (sīla) for different practitioners. Here's a breakdown of the main precept groups:

1. **Five Precepts** (Pañca Sīlāni) - For lay followers in daily life:
   - Abstaining from killing living beings
   - Abstaining from taking what is not given (stealing)
   - Abstaining from sexual misconduct
   - Abstaining from false speech (lying)
   - Abstaining from intoxicants that cause heedlessness

2. **Eight Precepts** (Aṭṭha Sīlāni) - For lay followers on observance days (uposatha) or during intensive practice periods:
   - The first five precepts, with the third precept elevated to complete abstinence from sexual activity
   - Abstaining from eating after midday
   - Abstaining from dancing, singing, music, shows, wearing garlands, perfumes, and cosmetics
   - Abstaining from high and luxurious beds and seats

3. **Ten Precepts** (Dasa Sīlāni) - For novice monks (sāmaṇera) and nuns (sāmaṇerī):
   - The eight precepts, with the seventh precept split into two separate precepts:
     - Abstaining from dancing, singing, music, and shows
     - Abstaining from wearing garlands, perfumes, and cosmetics
   - And adding: Abstaining from accepting gold and silver (money)

4. **227 Precepts** (Bhikkhu Pātimokkha) - For fully ordained monks
   - These are detailed in the Vinaya Piṭaka and categorized by severity of offense

5. **311 Precepts** (Bhikkhunī Pātimokkha) - For fully ordained nuns
   - Also detailed in the Vinaya Piṭaka

6. **Ten Precepts for Virtuous Conduct** (Dasa Kusala Kammapatha) - Differs from the novice ten precepts:
   - Three bodily actions: abstaining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct
   - Four verbal actions: abstaining from lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, idle chatter
   - Three mental actions: abstaining from covetousness, ill will, wrong view

While the five and eight precepts are most common for laypeople, the monastic precepts form the foundation of the monastic community (Sangha) and have been preserved with remarkable consistency since early Buddhism.
