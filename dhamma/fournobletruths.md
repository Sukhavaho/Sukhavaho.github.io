## [The Four Noble Truths](https://sukhavaho.github.io/dhamma/lists)

The Eightfold Path (Aṭṭhaṅgika Magga) is the core teaching of the Buddha that outlines the way to liberation (nibbāna) by overcoming suffering (dukkha). It is the fourth of the Four Noble Truths and represents the practical means to achieve the cessation of suffering. It is divided into three broad categories: wisdom (paññā), ethics (sīla), and mental discipline (samādhi).

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Wisdom (Paññā):
	•	1. Sammā-diṭṭhi: Right View
Understanding the Four Noble Truths, the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation.
	•	2. Sammā-saṅkappa: Right Intention
Cultivating intentions of renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness, while abandoning thoughts of desire, ill-will, and cruelty.

2. Ethics (Sīla):
	•	3. Sammā-vācā: Right Speech
Speaking truthfully, avoiding slander, harsh speech, and idle chatter.
	•	4. Sammā-kammanta: Right Action
Acting ethically by refraining from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct.
	•	5. Sammā-ājīva: Right Livelihood
Earning a living in ways that do not cause harm to others or violate ethical principles.

3. Mental Discipline (Samādhi):
	•	6. Sammā-vāyāma: Right Effort
Making effort to prevent unwholesome states from arising, abandon those that have arisen, and cultivate wholesome states.
	•	7. Sammā-sati: Right Mindfulness
Developing mindfulness in four key areas: the body (kāyānupassanā), feelings (vedanānupassanā), mind (cittānupassanā), and mental phenomena (dhammānupassanā), as outlined in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta.
	•	8. Sammā-samādhi: Right Concentration
Cultivating deep meditative absorption (jhāna) leading to a stable and unified mind.

These eight factors are not sequential steps but interdependent practices that support each other. Together, they form the holistic path toward awakening.
