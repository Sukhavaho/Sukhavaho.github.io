# Unique Meditation Techniques in Early Buddhist Schools

#### First the Meditation Techniques
#### {Followed by the different schools}

The early Buddhist schools shared a common foundation of meditation practices derived from the Buddha's original teachings, but over time developed distinctive approaches and emphases. While the historical record is incomplete regarding all early schools' specific meditation techniques, we can identify some unique characteristics in the traditions for which information has survived.

## Pre-Sectarian Foundation

Before examining school-specific techniques, it's important to understand the shared foundation. Early Buddhist meditation included:

- The Four Foundations of Mindfulness (as described in the Satipatthana Sutta)
- The practice of jhāna/dhyāna (meditative absorptions)
- Preparatory practices including morality (sila), sense restraint, and right effort[2]

These core practices were interpreted and systematized differently as Buddhism developed into distinct schools.

## Theravada Distinctive Approaches

While modern Theravada preserves early Buddhist meditation techniques, its classical meditation manual, the 5th-century *Visuddhimagga* by Buddhaghoṣa, represents a significant development:

- Strong emphasis on **kasina meditation** (concentration on visual objects) as a central practice, which "departs from the Pali Canon, in which *dhyana* is the central meditative practice"[2]
- Systematization of forty meditation subjects, including:
  - Ten kasinas (earth, water, fire, air, blue, yellow, red, white, light, and "limited-space")
  - Ten kinds of foulness meditations
  - Ten recollections
  - Four divine abodes
  - Four immaterial states
  - One perception and one "defining"[2]

This elaborate system represents an evolution from earlier approaches, showing how the Theravada tradition developed its distinctive meditation framework.

## Sarvāstivāda Innovations

The Sarvāstivāda school, which was influential in North India and Central Asia before eventually disappearing, developed several unique meditation approaches:

- A personality-based system of five meditation techniques:
  1. Contemplation on the impure (*asubhabhavana*) for greedy personality types
  2. Meditation on loving kindness (*maitri*) for hateful types
  3. Contemplation on conditioned co-arising for deluded types
  4. Contemplation on the division of the dhatus for conceited types
  5. Mindfulness of breathing (*anapanasmrti*) for distracted types[2]

- A distinctive **sixfold breathing meditation** system that was particularly influential in East Asia:
  1. Counting breaths up to ten
  2. Following the breath through the body
  3. Fixing the mind on the breath
  4. Observing the breath at various locations
  5. Modifying (related to the four applications of mindfulness)
  6. Purifying (the arising of insight)[2]

- Special emphasis on contemplation of the impure and mindfulness of breathing as "gateways to immortality" (*amrta-dvāra*)[2]

This sixfold breathing system was later expanded upon by Chinese Tiantai master Zhiyi, showing its lasting influence in East Asian Buddhism.

## Yogācāra Practitioners

Within the Sarvāstivāda tradition, specialized meditation practitioners known as *yogācāras* developed approaches that were preserved in texts called *Dhyāna sutras* or "meditation summaries." These teachings focused on "concrete details of the meditative practice" and were influential in the development of both Mahayana meditation and possibly Yogacara philosophy[2].

## Legacy in Later Traditions

The search results indicate that "early Buddhist practice has been incorporated to greater and lesser degrees into the Tibetan Buddhism and the East Asian Mahayana Buddhism"[1]. The Sarvāstivāda approaches in particular had significant influence on Chinese Buddhism, with their sixfold breathing method being adapted and expanded in East Asian traditions[2].

## Conclusion

While information about specific meditation techniques for all early Buddhist schools remains incomplete, we can identify distinctive approaches in the Theravada and Sarvāstivāda traditions. The former developed an elaborate system centered on kasina meditation, while the latter created personality-based approaches and a unique sixfold breathing technique. These varying approaches demonstrate how meditation practice evolved as Buddhism spread and diversified across Asia.
