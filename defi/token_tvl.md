# Token Total Value Locked (TVL)

## Back to [Token Metrics](token_metrics)

Total Value Locked (TVL): This metric is particularly relevant for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and is the total value of all assets (in USD) locked in a protocol's smart contracts. It reflects the amount of liquidity and user engagement within a DeFi ecosystem. A high TVL can signal strong user trust and utility, but it's not a perfect indicator. It's important to consider:



Is the TVL high due to a small number of large investors or a broad base of users?

Is the TVL inflated by "yield farming" incentives that might not be sustainable?

High TVL does not guarantee security. Audits and a project's history of security are crucial.
