# Token Velocity

## Back to: [Token Metrics](token_metrics)

Token Velocity: This metric measures how often a token changes hands within a given period. It's calculated by dividing the total transaction volume by the average market cap.
Token Velocity= 
Average Market Cap
Total Transaction Volume
​
 
A high velocity can suggest that the token is primarily used for speculation rather than as a store of value. Conversely, a low velocity can indicate that users are holding the token for its long-term value or for use cases like staking.
