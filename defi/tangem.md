# Tangem Wallet





### Gemini 11-07-2025
Unlike hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor, which are often used as "signers" for third-party software wallets like MetaMask or Phantom, the Tangem hardware wallet is designed to work almost exclusively with its own native application.

The primary and most popular Web3 wallet that integrates with the Tangem hardware card is the official Tangem Wallet app (for iOS and Android).

The Tangem Integration Model: App + WalletConnect
Your Tangem card (or cards) acts as the secure key to unlock the Tangem Wallet software on your phone. This app is your all-in-one wallet.

To connect to DApps (Decentralized Apps) and the wider Web3, you do not connect your Tangem to MetaMask. Instead, you use the WalletConnect protocol, which is built directly into the Tangem Wallet app.

WalletConnect is the "bridge" that securely links your Tangem Wallet app to thousands of Web3 DApps.

Popular Web3 DApps You Can Use with Tangem (via WalletConnect)
When you use the Tangem Wallet, your "integration list" is essentially any DApp that supports WalletConnect. You simply go to the DApp's website on your desktop or mobile browser, click "Connect Wallet," and choose the WalletConnect option. This will show a QR code that you scan using the WalletConnect feature inside your Tangem app.
