TUM Blockchain Conference: Held in Munich, Germany, often involves academic collaboration.
Academic Workshops and Research Symposiums by University Research Centers: Many universities with research centers in blockchain host workshops and symposiums showcasing cutting-edge research.
DLT International Conference on Developments in Language Theory: Includes a specific track for Distributed Ledger Technology research. 
This list prioritizes conferences with a clear academic and research emphasis, distinguishing them from more industry-focused events. 


It's challenging to provide a definitive, ranked list of university blockchain clubs based purely on "priority/size/value," as these metrics are not consistently tracked or publicly available for student organizations. However, based on the influence of their associated university's research centers, academic programs, industry collaborations, and the clubs' own initiatives (education, consulting, research, accelerators), here's a list of top university blockchain and DeFi clubs that are consistently recognized for their impact:
1. Blockchain at Berkeley
University: University of California, Berkeley
Key Highlights: One of the earliest and most well-known clubs, known for offering the world's first undergraduate university-accredited blockchain course (Blockchain Fundamentals Decal), consulting, research, and an accelerator. Alchemy notes it focuses on blockchain education, consulting, and research. Their Xcelerator has propelled 85 companies, securing over $450 million in funding since January 2019. 
2. Stanford Blockchain Club
University: Stanford University
Key Highlights: Deep ties to the Stanford Center for Blockchain Research (CBR), a leading academic research center. Offers events, classes, research projects, and supports student ventures through the Stanford Blockchain Accelerator, with many teams raising significant funding. It's focused on bringing more adoption to emerging blockchain tech. 
3. Cornell Blockchain Club
University: Cornell University
Key Highlights: Focused on exploring blockchain tech, educating students, and building real-world use cases. It has an accelerator program that has helped past cohorts secure over $1.5 million in funding. 
4. Harvard Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Club
University: Harvard University
Key Highlights: Aims to increase blockchain adoption and likely collaborates with Harvard's strong research initiatives in the area. 
5. MIT Sloan Blockchain Club / MIT Blockchain Initiatives
University: Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
