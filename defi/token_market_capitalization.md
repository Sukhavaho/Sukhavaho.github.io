# Token Market Capitalization

## Back to: [Token Metrics](token_metrics)

Market Capitalization: This is the total value of all tokens in circulation. It's calculated as:
Market Cap=Circulating Supply×Current Token Price
Market cap is a better indicator of a token's size and dominance than its price alone. A high market cap often suggests more liquidity and a more mature project, which can be seen as a sign of relative safety.
