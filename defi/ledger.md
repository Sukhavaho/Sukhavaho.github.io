Of course. The integration model for Ledger is different from Tangem's. While Tangem uses its own all-in-one app, Ledger's hardware is designed to act as a secure "signing" device that connects to a wide variety of popular third-party software wallets.

The most important wallet is Ledger's own, but the most popular DApp integrations happen through other wallets.

Here are the top popular Web3 wallets that integrate with your Ledger hardware wallet, broken down by their primary ecosystem.

### 1. Ledger Wallet (formerly Ledger Live)
This is the official, all-in-one software from Ledger. It is the primary application for managing your assets, installing apps on your device, and accessing many DeFi services like staking, swapping, and lending directly through its "Discover" section.

* **Best for:** Securely managing your portfolio, staking, and accessing DApps that are officially vetted and integrated by Ledger.
* **Integration:** This is the native app for the hardware.

### 2. MetaMask
This is the most popular software wallet in the world and the primary gateway to the Ethereum and EVM-compatible ecosystems (such as Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Smart Chain, and Arbitrum). You can connect your Ledger directly to MetaMask to manage your assets and sign transactions.

* **Best for:** Interacting with virtually any DApp, DEX, or NFT marketplace on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains.
* **Integration:** You use the "Connect Hardware Wallet" feature within MetaMask to add your Ledger account. MetaMask creates the transactions, but you must physically approve them on your Ledger device.

### 3. Phantom
This is the most popular software wallet for the **Solana** ecosystem. It is the "MetaMask of Solana." If you want to interact with Solana-based DApps, mint NFTs, or use Solana-based liquid staking, Phantom is the go-to choice.

* **Best for:** All DApp activity on the Solana network, including trading, NFTs, and DeFi.
* **Integration:** Similar to MetaMask, Phantom's "Connect Hardware Wallet" feature allows you to import your Ledger's Solana account. All transactions are then signed securely on your Ledger device.

### 4. Solflare
This is the second most popular wallet for the **Solana** ecosystem and was one of the very first. It is a powerful and robust wallet that is a favorite among many Solana users and developers. It offers a web-based wallet, a browser extension, and a mobile app.

* **Best for:** Users who want a dedicated, powerful, and feature-rich alternative to Phantom for the Solana network.
* **Integration:** Solflare has a seamless integration with Ledger for both its web wallet and browser extension, allowing you to sign all transactions with your hardware.

### 5. MyEtherWallet (MEW)
MEW is one of the original and most-trusted wallets for the **Ethereum** ecosystem. While MetaMask has become more popular for DApp interaction, MEW is known for its robust and "to-the-point" interface for managing assets, sending transactions, and interacting with smart contracts.

* **Best for:** A powerful and straightforward interface for managing Ethereum assets, especially for users who prefer a non-browser-extension wallet.
* **Integration:** MEW has had strong hardware wallet support from the beginning and offers a very reliable connection to Ledger devices.

### Summary: How to Choose

| Wallet | Primary Ecosystem(s) | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ledger Wallet** | All (Multi-chain) | Overall portfolio management, staking, and in-app DApps. |
| **MetaMask** | Ethereum & EVM-Chains | The #1 choice for DeFi and NFTs on Ethereum, Polygon, etc. |
| **Phantom** | Solana | The #1 choice for all DApp activity on Solana. |
| **Solflare** | Solana | A top-tier alternative for Solana DApps and staking. |
| **MyEtherWallet** | Ethereum | A classic, powerful interface for managing Ethereum assets. |

Most people who use a Ledger will have **Ledger Wallet** (for core management) and then add **MetaMask** and/or **Phantom** to interact with the decentralized web.
