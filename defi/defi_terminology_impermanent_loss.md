# IL - Impermanent Loss

This describes the temporary loss of funds that a liquidity provider can experience when the price of their deposited assets changes compared to when they initially deposited them. It is "impermanent" because the loss only becomes permanent if the liquidity provider withdraws their assets at a lower value.
