Hereâ€™s a taxonomy of DEX categories, grouped by their core mechanism and design:

â¸»

1. Order Book DEXs
	â€¢	On-chain order book â€“ All orders live fully on-chain (expensive, less common).
	â€¢	Example: Serum (Solana).
	â€¢	Off-chain order book / on-chain settlement â€“ Matching engine off-chain, settlement on-chain (faster, more efficient).
	â€¢	Examples: dYdX (perpetuals), 0x.

â¸»

2. AMM DEXs (Automated Market Makers)
	â€¢	Constant Product AMMs (x * y = k) â€“ Liquidity pools set price by curve.
	â€¢	Examples: Uniswap v2, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap.
	â€¢	Constant Sum AMMs â€“ Better for stable pairs, but more risk of imbalance.
	â€¢	Example: DODO (hybrid).
	â€¢	StableSwap Invariant AMMs â€“ Curve-like design for low-slippage swaps of correlated assets (stablecoins, LSDs).
	â€¢	Examples: Curve, Saddle, Ellipsis.
	â€¢	Hybrid AMMs â€“ Combine multiple pricing functions.
	â€¢	Examples: Balancer (multi-asset pools), Kyber DMM (dynamic curves).

â¸»

3. Aggregator DEXs
	â€¢	Route orders across multiple DEXs for best price.
	â€¢	Examples: 1inch, Matcha (0x), Paraswap, OpenOcean.

â¸»

4. Perpetual / Derivatives DEXs
	â€¢	Focused on perpetual futures, options, leveraged trading.
	â€¢	Perpetuals: dYdX, GMX, Synthetix Perps, Perpetual Protocol.
	â€¢	Options: Aevo (Ribbon), Dopex, Lyra.
	â€¢	Structured Products: Pendle (yield tokenization), Opyn.

â¸»

5. RFQ (Request-for-Quote) DEXs
	â€¢	User requests price, professional market makers respond with quotes.
	â€¢	Efficient for large block trades, less MEV exposure.
	â€¢	Examples: 0x RFQ, CowSwap (batch auctions + RFQ).

â¸»

6. Cross-chain / Multi-chain DEXs
	â€¢	Native swaps across chains, sometimes using bridges or messaging protocols.
	â€¢	Examples: Thorchain, Wormhole-based DEXs, SushiXSwap.

â¸»

7. NFT DEXs
	â€¢	For trading NFTs (single tokens, not fungible pairs).
	â€¢	Examples: OpenSea (partially decentralized), Blur, Sudoswap (AMM for NFTs).

â¸»

8. Hybrid / New Models
	â€¢	Batch Auction DEXs â€“ Aggregate orders into batches to minimize MEV and ensure fair pricing.
	â€¢	Example: CowSwap.
	â€¢	Intent-based DEXs â€“ Users declare what they want, solvers compete to execute optimally.
	â€¢	Example: Anoma, CowSwap (moving toward intents).
	â€¢	On-chain RFQ + AMM combos â€“ Mix of quotes + pools for better liquidity.

â¸»

ðŸ‘‰ So in short, the major categories of DEXs are:
(1) Order Book, (2) AMM (with subtypes), (3) Aggregators, (4) Derivatives/Perps, (5) RFQ, (6) Cross-chain, (7) NFT-focused, (8) Hybrid/Intent-based.

Do you want me to build you a visual taxonomy map (mind-map style) of DEX categories like we did for DeFi?
