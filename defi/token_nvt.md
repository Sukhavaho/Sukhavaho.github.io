# TOken Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio

## Back to: [Token Metrics](token_metrics)

Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio: Analogous to the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio in traditional finance, the NVT ratio compares a project's market cap to the value of on-chain transactions. A high NVT ratio can suggest that the token is overvalued relative to its actual use, while a low ratio might indicate it's undervalued.
