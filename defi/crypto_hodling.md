# Crypto HODLing


# ChatGPT 08-27-2025 Criteria:
Hereâ€™s a solid framework of metrics you can use when evaluating a crypto project for a long-term hold (hodl):

â¸»

1. Fundamentals of the Project

1.1	Whitepaper & Vision â€“ Does it solve a real problem? Or is it hype?

1.2	Use Case / Utility â€“ Is the token necessary for the network? Or is it just a speculative wrapper?

1.3	Ecosystem Adoption â€“ Whoâ€™s building on it? Are developers, users, and businesses adopting it?

â¸»

2. Team & Governance
â€¢	Founders & Developers â€“ Track record, credibility, and commitment.
â€¢	Decentralization â€“ Who controls decisions? DAO vs centralized foundation.
â€¢	Community Strength â€“ Is there a large, active, aligned community? (Check GitHub commits, Discord, X/Twitter activity.)

â¸»

3. Tokenomics
â€¢	Supply â€“ Max supply, circulating supply, inflation/deflation.
â€¢	Distribution â€“ Who owns it? Any whale concentration? (Check on-chain data.)
â€¢	Emission Schedule â€“ How fast are new tokens minted? Any cliffs/vesting for insiders?
â€¢	Burn Mechanisms / Sink â€“ Does usage reduce supply (e.g., ETH burn via EIP-1559)?

â¸»

4. Network Health
â€¢	Security â€“ History of hacks, audits, vulnerabilities.
â€¢	Validators / Miners â€“ Number, distribution, cost of attack.
â€¢	Scalability â€“ TPS, throughput, layer-2 support.
â€¢	Reliability â€“ Downtime? Frequent chain halts?

â¸»

5. Market Metrics
â€¢	Market Cap vs FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation) â€“ Cheap or expensive relative to supply?
â€¢	Liquidity â€“ Can you exit without moving the market? (Look at exchange depth.)
â€¢	Volatility â€“ Long-term stability vs pump-and-dump charts.
â€¢	Correlation â€“ Does it move independently of BTC/ETH, or just follow?

â¸»

6. On-Chain Metrics
	â€¢	Active Addresses â€“ Are more people using it over time?
	â€¢	Transaction Volume â€“ Is it growing?
	â€¢	TVL (for DeFi) â€“ Value locked in protocols.
	â€¢	Developer Activity â€“ Commits, forks, active contributors.

â¸»

7. Macro & Regulation
	â€¢	Narrative Alignment â€“ Does it fit into growing trends (AI, DeFi, RWAs, privacy, L2s)?
	â€¢	Regulatory Risk â€“ Could the SEC or other regulators classify it as a security?
	â€¢	Jurisdictional Acceptance â€“ Is it being integrated into legal finance (ETFs, banking, remittances)?

â¸»

8. Time-Tested Filters
	â€¢	Lindy Effect â€“ The longer itâ€™s survived, the more likely it continues (e.g. BTC, ETH).
	â€¢	Network Effects â€“ More users = more value = stronger moat.
	â€¢	Resilience â€“ How did it handle previous bear markets?

ðŸ‘‰ If you want, I can make you a Crypto Long-Term HODL Scorecard (in markdown or spreadsheet form) where you can rate any token on these metrics before buying. Want me to draft one?
