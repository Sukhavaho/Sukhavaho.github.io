# Token Circulating Supply vs Total Supply

## Back to [Token Metrics](token_metrics)

Circulating Supply vs. Total Supply:

Circulating Supply: The number of tokens currently available and actively traded in the market.

Total Supply: The total number of tokens that will ever exist, including those not yet in circulation (e.g., locked for future release, held by the team or investors).
The difference between these two metrics is critical for understanding future token inflation and potential price pressure from future unlocks. A large number of tokens scheduled to be released can dilute the value of existing tokens.
