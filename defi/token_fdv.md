# Token Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV)

## Back to: [Token Metrics](token_metrics)

Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV): This is the market cap if all tokens in the total supply were in circulation.
FDV=Total Supply×Current Token Price
Comparing the FDV to the current market cap can give you a sense of a token's future valuation and potential for inflation. A project with a much higher FDV than its current market cap may face significant selling pressure when locked tokens are released.
