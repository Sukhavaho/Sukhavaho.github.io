# Order Book DEXs


Order Book DEXs
This model is more similar to a traditional centralized exchange (CEX), but it operates in a decentralized way.

How it works: Users place "buy" and "sell" orders for tokens, which are then listed on an order book. The exchange's smart contracts match buyers and sellers when their orders align.


Key characteristics:

Uses a traditional order book, just like CEXs.

Can have issues with liquidity and "slippage" (the difference between the expected and executed price) if there aren't enough orders on the book.

Examples: dYdX (some of its features), and previously platforms like EtherDelta.
