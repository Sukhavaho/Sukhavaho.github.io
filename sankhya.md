## What is the Sāṅkhya School
The **Sāṅkhya school** is one of the six classical orthodox schools (darśanas) of Indian philosophy, dating back to ancient times. It is primarily a **dualistic** system that offers a metaphysical explanation of the universe, focusing on two fundamental realities: **Puruṣa** (consciousness) and **Prakṛti** (matter or nature).

### Key Concepts of Sāṅkhya:

1. **Dualism (Dvaita)**:
   - **Puruṣa**: This refers to the eternal, unchanging, passive consciousness or the true self. It is pure awareness, separate from the material world and is not involved in any activities.
   - **Prakṛti**: Prakṛti represents nature or matter, which is the active principle of creation. It is composed of three **guṇas** (qualities): sattva (balance, harmony), rajas (activity, passion), and tamas (inertia, darkness). Prakṛti undergoes transformation and is responsible for the manifest universe, including the body and mind.

2. **Cosmology and Evolution**:
   - The Sāṅkhya school posits that the entire universe evolves from the interaction between Puruṣa and Prakṛti. When Puruṣa comes into proximity with Prakṛti, it triggers an imbalance in the guṇas, leading to the creation of the universe. This process gives rise to various elements of the cosmos, including the **mahat** (cosmic intelligence), **ahaṅkāra** (ego or sense of individuality), the five subtle elements (tanmātras), the five gross elements, and the mind (manas).

3. **Goal of Liberation (Mokṣa)**:
   - In Sāṅkhya, the ultimate goal is **mokṣa** or liberation, which is achieved through **discriminative knowledge** (viveka) between Puruṣa and Prakṛti. Liberation occurs when the individual realizes that their true self (Puruṣa) is separate from the material world (Prakṛti). This leads to the cessation of suffering and the end of the cycle of birth and rebirth (samsāra).

4. **Atheism and Theism**:
   - **Sāṅkhya is considered non-theistic** or atheistic in its classical form because it does not posit the existence of a creator God. Instead, the universe's creation and evolution are seen as the result of the interaction between Puruṣa and Prakṛti without any divine intervention.
   - However, later interpretations of Sāṅkhya (such as in Yoga philosophy, which integrates Sāṅkhya metaphysics) sometimes incorporate theistic elements, especially in connection with devotion and surrender to a personal god (Īśvara).

5. **Relation to Yoga**:
   - **Sāṅkhya and Yoga** are closely linked. The **Yoga school** of philosophy, as codified in **Patañjali's Yoga Sūtras**, borrows heavily from Sāṅkhya metaphysics, particularly the dualism of Puruṣa and Prakṛti. However, while Sāṅkhya focuses on knowledge and discernment to achieve liberation, Yoga emphasizes meditative practices, self-discipline, and control over the body and mind to attain the same goal.

### Summary of Sāṅkhya:
Sāṅkhya is a **dualistic system** that explains reality through the interaction between the eternal, passive consciousness (Puruṣa) and the active, material universe (Prakṛti). It teaches that liberation is achieved by discerning the separation between the self and the material world. This school profoundly influenced other Indian philosophical systems, especially the Yoga school, and its metaphysical ideas are key to understanding classical Indian views on consciousness and the nature of reality.

## What are the Tattvas
In **Sāṅkhya philosophy**, the **tattvas** are the fundamental principles or elements that make up the cosmos. There are **25 tattvas** in total, divided into categories that explain the relationship between consciousness (**Puruṣa**) and the material world (**Prakṛti**). The evolution of the universe in Sāṅkhya begins with Prakṛti (the unmanifested primordial matter) and proceeds through a series of transformations, resulting in the manifest world. Here's a breakdown of the 25 tattvas:

### 1. **Puruṣa (Consciousness)**
- **Puruṣa**: The first and foremost tattva, **Puruṣa** represents the pure, unchanging consciousness or the individual self. It is passive, eternal, and not involved in the activities of the material world.

### 2. **Prakṛti (Nature)**
- **Prakṛti**: The second primary tattva, **Prakṛti** is the primordial, unmanifested matter. It is the source of all material creation and contains the three **guṇas** (sattva, rajas, tamas). When Prakṛti comes into contact with Puruṣa, it initiates the process of cosmic evolution.

### 3. **Mahat (Cosmic Intelligence)**
- **Mahat**: The first product of the interaction between Puruṣa and Prakṛti, **Mahat** is cosmic intelligence or the universal mind. It represents the principle of intellect (buddhi) and is responsible for discrimination and decision-making.

### 4. **Ahaṅkāra (Ego, Sense of "I")**
- **Ahaṅkāra**: Arising from Mahat, **Ahaṅkāra** is the sense of individuality or ego. It creates the sense of self and is responsible for personal identity. Ahaṅkāra further differentiates into three categories based on the influence of the guṇas:
  - **Sāttvika Ahaṅkāra** (pure): Gives rise to the mind and the senses.
  - **Rājasa Ahaṅkāra** (active): Facilitates movement and action.
  - **Tāmasa Ahaṅkāra** (dark): Leads to the creation of the five subtle elements.

### 5. **Manas (Mind)**
- **Manas**: The **mind** is the coordinating organ that processes sensory input and communicates between the senses and the intellect (buddhi). It arises from sāttvika ahaṅkāra and helps with perception and decision-making.

### 6-10. **Jñānendriyas (Five Sense Organs)**
These are the faculties through which we perceive the external world. They arise from sāttvika ahaṅkāra:
1. **Chakṣus**: Organ of sight (eyes).
2. **Śrotra**: Organ of hearing (ears).
3. **Ghrāṇa**: Organ of smell (nose).
4. **Jihvā**: Organ of taste (tongue).
5. **Tvak**: Organ of touch (skin).

### 11-15. **Karmendriyas (Five Motor Organs)**
These are the organs of action, also arising from sāttvika ahaṅkāra:
1. **Vāk**: Organ of speech (mouth).
2. **Pāṇi**: Organ of grasping (hands).
3. **Pāda**: Organ of locomotion (feet).
4. **Pāyu**: Organ of excretion (anus).
5. **Upastha**: Organ of reproduction (genitals).

### 16-20. **Tanmatras (Five Subtle Elements)**
These are the subtle or potential forms of the gross elements (mahābhūtas) and arise from tāmasa ahaṅkāra:
1. **Śabda**: Sound (subtle element of space).
2. **Sparśa**: Touch (subtle element of air).
3. **Rūpa**: Form (subtle element of fire).
4. **Rasa**: Taste (subtle element of water).
5. **Gandha**: Smell (subtle element of earth).

### 21-25. **Mahābhūtas (Five Gross Elements)**
These are the gross physical elements that constitute the material universe. They evolve from the tanmātras:
1. **Ākāśa**: Space or ether (from śabda).
2. **Vāyu**: Air or wind (from sparśa).
3. **Tejas**: Fire or heat (from rūpa).
4. **Āpas**: Water or fluid (from rasa).
5. **Pṛthvī**: Earth or solidity (from gandha).

### Summary:
The **Sāṅkhya tattvas** form a comprehensive metaphysical framework that explains how the universe evolves from unmanifest matter (**Prakṛti**) into the diverse material world, while **Puruṣa** remains the passive observer of this process. These 25 tattvas outline the progression from the subtle, unmanifest states of existence to the tangible, manifest universe, offering a detailed map of cosmic evolution and the individual's interaction with reality.

## Is Sāṅkhya Ontological or Epistemological?
**Sāṅkhya** is primarily an **ontological** system of philosophy, although it has epistemological components as well.

### **Ontology in Sāṅkhya**:
Sāṅkhya focuses on the **nature of reality** and the **fundamental constituents of the universe**. Its main concern is **explaining the existence and interaction of two fundamental entities:**
- **Puruṣa (Consciousness)**: The eternal, unchanging, passive observer or pure consciousness.
- **Prakṛti (Nature or Matter)**: The primordial, active material cause of the universe, composed of the three guṇas (sattva, rajas, tamas).

Sāṅkhya's ontological framework is deeply concerned with the **process of cosmic evolution** from unmanifested Prakṛti into the manifested world of physical and mental phenomena through the 25 tattvas (principles or elements). It explains how everything that exists arises from the interaction of these two fundamental realities.

### **Epistemology in Sāṅkhya**:
While Sāṅkhya is more focused on ontology, it does have an epistemological dimension, dealing with how knowledge is obtained. Sāṅkhya recognizes three **pramāṇas (valid means of knowledge)**:
1. **Pratyakṣa (Direct Perception)**: Knowledge gained through the direct experience of the senses.
2. **Anumāna (Inference)**: Knowledge derived through logical reasoning and inference.
3. **Śabda (Verbal Testimony)**: Knowledge that is transmitted through authoritative texts or teachings, such as the Vedas.

These epistemological tools are used to help the practitioner discern the difference between **Puruṣa and Prakṛti**, ultimately leading to **liberation (mokṣa)** through knowledge.

### Conclusion:
Sāṅkhya is primarily **ontological** in nature because it seeks to describe the structure of reality and the fundamental principles that constitute existence. However, its epistemological aspects support its ontological goals by providing methods for acquiring knowledge about the true nature of reality, particularly the distinction between consciousness (Puruṣa) and matter (Prakṛti).
