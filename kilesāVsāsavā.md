**Kilesā** and **āsavā** are both terms in Theravāda Buddhism that refer to mental defilements or impurities, but they have different connotations and refer to slightly different aspects of the mind's afflictions.

### **Kilesā:**
- **Meaning:** The term *kilesā* refers to the defilements or afflictions that arise in the mind, leading to unwholesome thoughts, actions, and behaviors. These include greed (lobha), hatred (dosa), and delusion (moha), as well as other associated mental impurities like pride (māna), wrong view (diṭṭhi), jealousy (issā), and restlessness (uddhacca).

- **Scope:** Kilesā are the broader category of mental defilements that cover all forms of mental impurities that disturb the mind and lead to suffering. They are what directly afflict the mind in daily life and are the targets of purification practices in Buddhism.

- **Function:** Kilesā are the immediate causes of unwholesome actions and suffering. They are what drive people to engage in actions that perpetuate samsāra (the cycle of rebirth) and obstruct the path to enlightenment.

### **Āsavā:**
- **Meaning:** The term *āsavā* (sometimes translated as "cankers," "influxes," or "outflows") refers to deep-seated, underlying tendencies or latent predispositions that keep the mind bound to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. They are more fundamental and are considered the root sources from which kilesā arise.

- **Types of Āsavā:**
  1. **Kāmāsava**: The influx of sensual desire.
  2. **Bhavāsava**: The influx of becoming or desire for existence.
  3. **Diṭṭhāsava**: The influx of views, particularly wrong views.
  4. **Avijjāsava**: The influx of ignorance or delusion.

- **Scope:** Āsavā represent deeper, more primal influences that give rise to kilesā. They are like the underlying currents that feed into the more specific and immediate defilements (kilesā).

- **Function:** Āsavā are considered the most subtle and profound causes of samsāra, maintaining the continuity of existence and fueling the rebirth process. Eradication of the āsavā is achieved only at the level of **arahantship**, the final stage of enlightenment.

### **Summary of Differences:**

- **Nature:**
  - **Kilesā** are the manifest defilements, the more active and observable mental impurities that directly cause unwholesome actions.
  - **Āsavā** are the underlying causes or tendencies that give rise to these defilements, representing deeper currents of mental impurity.

- **Scope:**
  - **Kilesā** are broader and cover a range of mental defilements.
  - **Āsavā** are more specific to fundamental predispositions or influxes that drive the cycle of rebirth.

- **Eradication:**
  - **Kilesā** can be weakened and eventually eradicated through practices like meditation and ethical conduct.
  - **Āsavā** are only completely eradicated upon reaching the final stage of spiritual development (arahantship), marking the end of the cycle of rebirth.

Both kilesā and āsavā are critical concepts in Buddhist psychology, representing different levels of mental impurities that practitioners must understand and overcome on the path to enlightenment.
