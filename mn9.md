# Sukhāvaho ? [SāriputtAI](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p25UYT2UR-sariputtai) : [Sammādiṭṭhisutta](https://suttacentral.net/mn9/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=linebyline&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)
## As a Scholar Monk, please give me some historical context on this Sutta, followed by a succinct but deep summary.
The **Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta** (MN 9), meaning "Right View," is a foundational discourse delivered by **Ven. Sāriputta** that outlines the nature of correct understanding in the Buddha's teaching. It explains right view as understanding the Four Noble Truths and the conditionality of all phenomena.

### Summary:
In the **Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta**, Sāriputta expounds on right view in a detailed and systematic manner, starting with an understanding of wholesome and unwholesome actions and extending into dependent origination (**paṭicca-samuppāda**). He describes how suffering (dukkha) arises from causes such as ignorance and craving, and how it can be ended by following the Noble Eightfold Path.

The sutta is structured around exploring key doctrinal themes such as:
1. **Kamma**: Understanding the nature of wholesome and unwholesome actions.
2. **The Four Nutriments**: Exploring how sustenance fuels existence and leads to suffering.
3. **Dependent Origination**: Analyzing how ignorance leads to formations, birth, and suffering.
4. **The Cessation of Suffering**: Seeing how suffering can be brought to an end through the removal of its causes.

Ven. Sāriputta, renowned for his deep wisdom, explains these points clearly, making this sutta an important study on the practical application of right view.

### Historical Context:
This sutta belongs to the **Majjhima Nikāya** and is set during the Buddha’s lifetime, where Sāriputta, one of the Buddha’s foremost disciples, delivers teachings in the Buddha's absence. The teaching reflects the early Buddhist period's emphasis on **paṭicca-samuppāda** (dependent origination) as a core framework for understanding the conditional nature of reality.

The Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta would have been addressed to monks and laypeople aiming to deepen their understanding of Buddhist philosophy, especially around ethical action, causality, and liberation. Historically, this sutta shows how early Buddhism systematized key teachings into an interconnected doctrine based on direct experience.

### Related Suttas:
1. **Mahācattārīsaka Sutta** (MN 117): Explores right view in the context of the Noble Eightfold Path, emphasizing the distinction between mundane and supramundane right view.
2. **Cūḷavedalla Sutta** (MN 44): Another sutta where right view is discussed in a question-and-answer format by Dhammadinnā, explaining key insights like feeling and perception.
3. **Pañcattaya Sutta** (MN 102): Deals with the purification of views and directly relates to wrong views and how they obstruct liberation.

### Interesting or Unusual Aspects:
One notable aspect of this sutta is that it is **not delivered by the Buddha himself but by Sāriputta**, reflecting his role as the Buddha's "right-hand disciple" in wisdom. It emphasizes the **analytical method of teaching** often associated with Sāriputta, breaking complex ideas into digestible parts. The methodical, almost Abhidhamma-like, analysis of right view makes it unusual among discourses, offering a detailed and structured exploration of concepts like **kamma** and **dependent origination**.

Furthermore, the sutta reinforces the idea that **right view is dynamic**—not just theoretical understanding but also a practical insight that gradually leads to liberation through the understanding of causality in everyday experiences.

In the **Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta** (MN 9), Ven. Sāriputta explains **dependent origination** (**paṭicca-samuppāda**) in a **reverse (backward) order** to help illustrate how the cessation of suffering can be achieved by understanding and eliminating its causes.

### Explanation of Dependent Origination "Backwards":

Normally, dependent origination is described forward, starting with **ignorance (avijjā)** and leading to **suffering (dukkha)**, following a chain of twelve links:
1. **Ignorance** → 2. **Volitional formations (saṅkhārā)** → 3. **Consciousness (viññāṇa)** → and so on, leading to 12. **Old age, death, and suffering (jarāmaraṇa, dukkha).**

In the **Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta**, however, Sāriputta presents it *backwards*, starting with **dukkha** (suffering) and tracing its cause step by step back to **avijjā** (ignorance). This approach emphasizes the cessation of suffering by eliminating the root causes. He reverses the sequence to demonstrate how each condition arises due to the preceding one, and how, by eradicating the earlier conditions, suffering ceases.

The "backwards" sequence goes as follows:
1. **Suffering (dukkha)** arises due to **birth (jāti)**.
2. **Birth** arises due to **becoming (bhava)**.
3. **Becoming** arises due to **clinging (upādāna)**.
4. **Clinging** arises due to **craving (taṇhā)**.
5. **Craving** arises due to **feeling (vedanā)**.
6. **Feeling** arises due to **contact (phassa)**.
7. **Contact** arises due to **the six sense bases (saḷāyatana)**.
8. **The six sense bases** arise due to **name-and-form (nāma-rūpa)**.
9. **Name-and-form** arises due to **consciousness (viññāṇa)**.
10. **Consciousness** arises due to **volitional formations (saṅkhārā)**.
11. **Volitional formations** arise due to **ignorance (avijjā)**.

By presenting the chain in reverse order, Sāriputta highlights that, to eliminate suffering, one must eliminate its immediate cause: birth. To stop birth, one must stop becoming, and so forth—tracing it all the way back to **ignorance (avijjā)**. When ignorance ceases, the entire chain collapses, and suffering ceases.

### Key Point:
This backward analysis emphasizes the **cessation aspect** of dependent origination, showing how each factor can be "stopped" by eliminating its cause. The practical focus here is not only on understanding the arising of suffering but more importantly on how to bring suffering to an end, step by step, by removing ignorance, craving, and so on.

This reverse method of teaching dependent origination is unique in its practicality, highlighting the **path to cessation** (nirodha) rather than just an explanation of how suffering arises.
