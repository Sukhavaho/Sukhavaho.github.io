### Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo's "Type 2" Meditation Technique

Ajahn Lee's "Type 2" breath meditation is a systematic approach to mindfulness of breathing. Let me explain the technique step-by-step, with special focus on the breathing patterns during the body scan.

## Basic Structure and Breathing During Scans

The technique has three main stages:

### Stage 1: Beginning Focus
1. Start by being aware of your breath at a single point (typically the nostrils or upper lip)
2. Notice whether the breath is comfortable or uncomfortable, long or short
3. Adjust your breathing to find what feels most comfortable and calming

### Stage 2: Body Scan with Breath Energy
This is where the breathing instructions become more specific:

1. **Inhale** while mentally tracing the breath energy from the nose down through the throat to the center of the chest
2. **Exhale** while visualizing the breath flowing from the chest to the navel
3. **Inhale** from the navel down to the lower abdomen
4. **Exhale** from the lower abdomen down to the end of the breath path

After establishing this core breath path, you begin the more comprehensive body scan:

- When scanning upward (from center to head): **Inhale** up through the spine to the back of the neck, then to the middle of the head
- When scanning downward: **Exhale** from the middle of the head down to the nose

- When scanning to the shoulders: **Inhale** from the base of the throat to the shoulders
- When scanning down the arms: **Exhale** from the shoulders down through the arms to the fingertips

- When scanning the front torso: **Inhale** from the base of the throat down through the front of the body
- When scanning lower body: **Exhale** from the chest down through the intestines

- When scanning the legs: **Inhale** from the base of the spine down to the thighs
- When scanning to feet: **Exhale** from the thighs down through the legs to the feet

### Stage 3: Unifying and Expanding Awareness
- After completing the scan, you rest in a state of whole-body awareness
- The breath becomes more refined and subtle
- Your attention expands to include the entire body simultaneously

## Origins and Context

Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo (1907-1961) was a prominent Thai Forest Tradition monk and student of the renowned meditation master Ajahn Mun. He developed two main meditation methods, with "Type 2" being his more advanced technique.

This method evolved from:
- Traditional Thai Forest Tradition practices
- Ajahn Lee's own direct meditation experiences
- His interpretation of the Anapanasati Sutta (Mindfulness of Breathing discourse)

## How It Differs from Other Theravada Techniques

1. **Energy-based approach**: Unlike more conventional Theravada methods that focus solely on the physical sensations of breathing, Ajahn Lee's technique incorporates awareness of the "breath energy" (lom) flowing through the body.

2. **Systematic body mapping**: The technique is more structured than many traditional methods, with specific pathways and sequences for the attention.

3. **Integration of concentration and insight**: While many techniques separate samatha and vipassana practice, Ajahn Lee's method integrates both from the beginning.

4. **Less emphasis on counting**: Many Theravada techniques rely on counting breaths initially, which Ajahn Lee's method de-emphasizes.

## Relationship to Samatha and Vipassana

Ajahn Lee's Type 2 method skillfully combines both samatha (concentration) and vipassana (insight) practices:

- **Samatha elements**: The systematic focusing on breath sensations develops concentration (jhana). The comfortable breathing and pleasant sensations that arise serve as the basis for deeper states of absorption.

- **Vipassana elements**: The awareness of breath energy throughout the body develops insight into the three characteristics:
  - Impermanence (anicca): Observing how breath energy constantly changes
  - Unsatisfactoriness (dukkha): Seeing how discomfort arises when breath energy is disturbed
  - Non-self (anatta): Recognizing the body as composed of elements rather than a solid self

The technique follows the Thai Forest Tradition perspective that samatha and vipassana are not separate practices but complementary aspects of the same path—concentration provides stability for insight, while insight deepens concentration.

Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo's "Type 2" Breath Meditation: Origins, Practice, and ComparisonPhra Suddhidhammaransi Gambhiramedhacarya (1907–1961), commonly known as Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo, stands as a significant figure in the Thai Forest Tradition of the Dhammayuttika Nikaya order of Theravada Buddhism.1 Born in the Ubon Ratchathani Province of Isan, he became a revered meditation teacher and a student of the esteemed Ajahn Mun Bhuridatta.1 Ajahn Lee is widely regarded as one of the greatest meditation masters of the Thai Forest Tradition in the 20th century, credited with devising some of the most comprehensive meditation instructions and composing a detailed map of the jhānas, or meditative absorptions.1 His pioneering efforts extended to bringing the teachings of this ascetic tradition from the secluded forests to the mainstream of Thai society.1 Among his various contributions to meditation practice, the "Type 2" breath meditation technique holds a notable place, emphasizing breath awareness and the sensations within the body.6 This report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the origins, practice, and unique aspects of Ajahn Lee's "Type 2" breath meditation technique.The "Type 2" meditation technique, as taught by Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo, is deeply rooted in the historical and doctrinal context of the Thai Forest Tradition.1 This tradition, known for its strict adherence to the Vinaya (monastic discipline) and its intensive focus on meditation, was established in the early 20th century by Ajahn Sao Kantasilo and Ajahn Mun Bhuridatta, who sought to revive a more rigorous and forest-dwelling monasticism.1 Ajahn Lee, as a dedicated student of Ajahn Mun, became a key figure in this lineage, embodying its emphasis on meditative practice.1 He distinguished himself by developing particularly comprehensive meditation instructions, a testament to his profound understanding and practical experience.1 In fact, Ajahn Lee composed systematic treatises on Buddhist practice, a unique contribution among the Ajahns of the Thai Wilderness tradition.2 The "Type 2" meditation is one of the specific methods that Ajahn Lee formulated as part of his broader teachings on breath meditation.6 It is important to note that this technique, while a specific development by Ajahn Lee, is not entirely novel; rather, it builds upon the foundational instructions on breath meditation provided by the Buddha in the Pali Canon.6 Ajahn Lee's contribution lies in his detailed elaboration of these core principles, offering a more expansive and accessible approach.6 To gain a thorough understanding of this technique, it is essential to refer to Ajahn Lee's own writings, such as "Keeping the Breath in Mind," which serve as primary sources for his practical instructions and insights into meditation.1 These works provide detailed guidance for practitioners seeking to develop both concentration and insight through breath meditation.9The core of Ajahn Lee's "Type 2" breath meditation lies in its emphasis on the breath not merely as the physical act of inhaling and exhaling air, but as a sensation and an energy flow that permeates the entire body.6 A fundamental principle of this technique is the encouragement to actively engage with the breath by observing its qualities – whether it feels comfortable or uncomfortable, broad or narrow, obstructed or free-flowing, fast or slow, short or long, warm or cool – and to adjust it until a comfortable rhythm is found.7 This adjustment is considered crucial for facilitating a deeper state of relaxation and concentration. The ultimate aim of this practice, as described in Ajahn Lee's teachings, is twofold: to improve the energy already existing in every part of the body, thereby aiding in contending with disease and pain, and to clarify the knowledge already within, which can then serve as a foundation for the development of skills leading to release and purity of heart.8 Furthermore, this meditation technique is presented as a means to address the fundamental problem of the mind: the stress and suffering it generates through its own thoughts and actions.6 Some interpretations of Ajahn Lee's method suggest it involves a form of "energy manipulation," akin to the concepts of "chi" or "prana," where the breath is used as a vehicle to direct and spread energy throughout the body.13 The initial steps of practicing "Type 2" meditation are clearly outlined in several sources. It typically begins with taking three or seven long in-and-out breaths while mentally reciting the syllables "Bud-" with the inhalation and "dho" with the exhalation, maintaining the length of the syllable in sync with the duration of the breath.7 Following this, the practitioner is instructed to maintain a clear and continuous awareness of each in-breath and out-breath.7 The next crucial step involves observing the various qualities of the breath and actively adjusting it to achieve a state of comfort.7To better understand the unique characteristics of Ajahn Lee's "Type 2" meditation, it is helpful to consider it within the broader context of other Buddhist breath meditation techniques. A foundational practice in Buddhism is Anapanasati, or mindfulness of breathing, which is rooted in the Anapanasati Sutta.18 This technique traditionally focuses on observing the natural, unforced flow of the breath as it enters and leaves the body.21 The practice often involves specific stages, such as counting the breaths or focusing on the sensations at the nostrils.19 The Anapanasati Sutta itself outlines sixteen steps encompassing awareness of long and short breaths, the entire body, calming bodily and mental fabrications, experiencing rapture and pleasure, and ultimately focusing on impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and relinquishment.24 While Anapanasati aims to quiet the mind and develop concentration, it is often considered a preliminary technique for deeper insights.22 Another significant breath meditation practice is Vipassana, or insight meditation.25 The goal of Vipassana is to gain direct insight into the true nature of reality, often described as "seeing things as they really are".28 Breath awareness plays a crucial role in Vipassana as a primary object of observation, helping practitioners to develop insight into the impermanent nature of all phenomena, including suffering.25 Vipassana emphasizes the non-judgmental observation of all sensations, including those associated with breathing, such as the rising and falling of the abdomen or the feeling of breath at the nostrils.27 Unlike Anapanasati's conceptual focus on "in" and "out," some Vipassana traditions emphasize the reality of sensations like heat or cold at the nostrils or the physical movement of the stomach.22 Samatha, or concentration meditation, represents another core type of Buddhist meditation.25 Its primary aim is to cultivate a deep state of calm and concentration by focusing the mind on a single object, which can be the breath, a visual object, or a mantra.25Ajahn Lee's "Type 2" meditation exhibits several distinguishing features when compared to these other common Buddhist breath meditation techniques. One notable difference lies in its initial emphasis on actively adjusting the breath to achieve comfort, a practice that contrasts with the traditional Anapanasati approach of observing the natural breath without manipulation from the outset.7 In "Type 2," the meditator takes a more active role in shaping the breath from the very beginning. Another key distinction is the "scanning" of breath sensations throughout the body, a systematic movement of awareness that is not typically found in the initial stages of Anapanasati, which often focuses on a single point of sensation like the nostrils or the abdomen.7 While some Vipassana practices may involve body scans, Ajahn Lee's method specifically directs the "breath sensation" as a form of energy. The use of "Bud-dho" as a meditation syllable is also a characteristic of "Type 2" meditation.7 While mantras or mental recitations can be used in other Buddhist traditions to strengthen mindfulness and settle the mind 9, the explicit and consistent pairing of "Bud-" with the in-breath and "dho" with the out-breath is a defining element of Ajahn Lee's technique. Furthermore, some sources suggest that advanced stages of Ajahn Lee's meditation practice may lead to the development of "intuitive powers" such as clairvoyance and clairaudience.1 While not the primary aim of all Buddhist meditation, this potential outcome is a notable aspect associated with Ajahn Lee's teachings.FeatureAjahn Lee's "Type 2" MeditationAnapanasatiVipassanaInitial FocusAdjusting breath for comfortObserving natural breathObserving natural breath/body sensationsBody AwarenessActive "scanning" of breath sensationFocus on nostrils/abdomenNon-directive observation of sensationsMantra Use"Bud-dho" often usedOptional use of counting or other objectsLess commonEmphasisEnergetic flow and well-beingTranquility and concentrationInsight into impermanence and sufferingTo embark on the practice of Ajahn Lee's "Type 2" meditation, one can follow these seven basic steps, as outlined in his teachings:
Initial Breathing and Mantra: Begin by assuming a comfortable posture, sitting erect but relaxed, and take three or seven long, deep breaths in and out. With each inhalation, mentally say "Bud-," and with each exhalation, mentally say "dho." Ensure the mental syllable extends for the entire duration of the breath.7
Awareness of Breath: Maintain a clear and focused awareness on each and every in-breath and out-breath.7
Observation and Adjustment: Observe the breath as it goes in and out, paying attention to whether it feels comfortable or uncomfortable, broad or narrow, obstructed or free-flowing, fast or slow, short or long, warm or cool. If the breath does not feel comfortable in any way, consciously adjust it until it does. For instance, if long breaths are uncomfortable, try shorter ones, and vice versa.7
Spreading Breath Sensation: Once a comfortable breath is established, inhale the sensation of the breath at the base of the skull and gently allow it to flow all the way down the spine. Then, if you are male, let this sensation spread down your right leg to the sole of your foot, to the ends of your toes, and then out into the air. Repeat this process, inhaling at the base of the skull and letting the sensation flow down the spine and then down your left leg to the ends of your toes and out. If you are female, begin with the left leg first, followed by the right leg. Next, from the base of the skull, let the breath sensation spread down over both shoulders, past your elbows and wrists, to the tips of your fingers, and out into the air. Then, allow the breath sensation from the base of the throat to flow down the central nerve at the front of the body, past the lungs and liver, all the way down to the bladder and colon. Finally, inhale the breath right at the middle of the chest and let it go all the way down to your intestines. Aim to let all these breath sensations spread and connect with one another, fostering an improved sense of well-being.7
Four Ways of Breathing: Familiarize yourself with four different ways of adjusting the breath: (a) in long and out long, (b) in long and out short, (c) in short and out long, and (d) in short and out short. Practice breathing in whichever way feels most comfortable at any given time. Ideally, learn to breathe comfortably in all four ways, as your physical condition and breath patterns are constantly changing.7
Focal Points (Bases): Become acquainted with the various "bases" or focal points where the mind can rest with the breath. These include: (a) the tip of the nose, (b) the middle of the head, (c) the palate, (d) the base of the throat, (e) the breastbone (the tip of the sternum), and (f) the navel (or a point just above it). Center your awareness on whichever of these points feels most comfortable. If you frequently experience headaches or nervous problems, avoid focusing on any spot above the base of the throat. Remember to breathe freely and naturally, allowing the mind to be at ease with the breath, but not to the point of losing focus.7
Full Body Awareness: Expand your awareness, your sense of conscious feeling, throughout your entire body.7
Uniting Breath Sensations: Finally, unite all the breath sensations you feel throughout your body, allowing them to flow together smoothly and comfortably. Maintain your awareness as broad as possible, encompassing the entirety of these sensations.7
Step NumberDescription1Begin with three or seven long in-and-out breaths, thinking "Bud-" with the in-breath and "dho" with the out-breath, synchronizing the syllable length with the breath.2Be clearly aware of each inhalation and exhalation.3Observe the breath's qualities and adjust it until it feels comfortable, experimenting with long/short breaths.4Inhale the "breath sensation" at the base of the skull and let it flow down the spine and then through the legs, shoulders, arms, throat, and chest, connecting these sensations.5Learn to breathe comfortably in four ways: long in/long out, long in/short out, short in/long out, short in/short out.6Become familiar with the focal points of the breath (nose tip, middle of head, palate, throat base, breastbone, navel) and center awareness on the most comfortable one.7Spread awareness throughout the entire body.8Unite the breath sensations throughout the body, allowing them to flow together comfortably while maintaining broad awareness.In Ajahn Lee's "Type 2" meditation, the term "scans" refers to the directed movement of one's awareness and the associated "breath sensation" through the various parts of the body, as meticulously detailed in step 4 of the practical guide.7 The purpose of these scans is multifaceted. Primarily, they aim to facilitate the spread of comfortable breath sensations throughout the entire body, which in turn fosters a profound sense of well-being.7 This directed flow of sensation is also intended to improve the overall energy flow within the body and address any potential blockages that might be present.34 Some interpretations suggest that this process is akin to "cutting away the dead parts of a plant" to encourage new growth or like "chewing food carefully" to enhance digestion, implying a process of purification and energetic integration within the body and mind.35 Furthermore, these scans serve as a way to engage the mind actively, providing it with a task that can help to settle it and prevent it from wandering.34 In some instances, Ajahn Lee's teachings suggest that these scans can even be used as a form of "physical examination," allowing practitioners to become more aware of aches, pains, or discomfort in the body and to use their breath to address them.34 It is important to distinguish these "scans" from body scans practiced in other meditation traditions, such as Vipassana or Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR).36 In certain Vipassana traditions, body scans involve a non-directive observation of whatever sensations arise in different parts of the body, without the active manipulation or direction of energy.36 Similarly, MBSR body scans guide attention systematically through the body to cultivate present moment awareness of sensations.37 The "scans" in Ajahn Lee's "Type 2" meditation, however, involve a more active approach, where the practitioner intentionally directs the "breath sensation" as a form of energy through specific pathways in the body.38The synchronization of inhalation and exhalation with the "scans" in Ajahn Lee's "Type 2" meditation is a crucial aspect of the practice. As described in the step-by-step guide, the instruction is to "inhale the breath sensation" at the designated starting point for each segment of the scan, such as the base of the skull, and then to "let it flow" along the specified path, for example, down the spine or through a limb.7 This coordinated movement of awareness and the imagined flow of "breath sensation" appears to occur primarily during the inhalation phase of the breath, although the sensation may be sustained through the exhalation as well. The instructions for each step of the scan explicitly guide this synchronization, for instance, by directing the practitioner to inhale at the base of the skull and then visualize or feel the sensation flowing downwards.33 Throughout this process, it is emphasized that the breath should remain comfortable and natural.7 Practitioners are cautioned against forcing or holding the breath in any way.10 It is also important to remember that the "breath sensation" being directed is not simply the physical air moving in and out of the lungs, but rather a felt sense of energy that accompanies the breath.6 Therefore, the synchronization involves intentionally using the inhalation as the vehicle to guide this felt energy and focused awareness through the body according to the specific instructions for each part of the "scan."The practice of Ajahn Lee's "Type 2" meditation offers a range of potential benefits for practitioners. Many report an improved sense of overall well-being as they become more attuned to their breath and body sensations.7 Some individuals have experienced increased energy levels and a reduction in fatigue through consistent practice.41 The technique is also believed to have the potential to aid in physical healing and the reduction of pain, as practitioners learn to direct their breath and awareness to areas of discomfort.8 Mentally, "Type 2" meditation can lead to a calming of the mind, a decrease in stress and suffering, and an enhancement of concentration, mindfulness, and alertness.6 For those seeking deeper meditative experiences, this method can also facilitate the development of jhānas, or meditative absorptions.14 In more advanced stages of practice, some traditions within this lineage suggest the possibility of developing heightened sensory and intuitive abilities.8 The process of actively engaging with the breath and directing sensations throughout the body is likened to refining and purifying both the physical and mental aspects of oneself.35 For those interested in pursuing this practice, there are several important considerations to keep in mind. It is crucial to begin by finding a comfortable posture that allows for sustained stillness and relaxation.12 Maintaining a relaxed and natural breath throughout the meditation is paramount; forcing or manipulating the breath beyond what feels comfortable can be counterproductive.7 Practitioners should also avoid trying to force specific experiences or enter a trance-like state.7 Patience and persistence are essential in any meditation practice, and "Type 2" is no exception.14 Distractions are a natural part of the meditative process, and rather than becoming discouraged, practitioners should gently redirect their attention back to the breath whenever the mind wanders.18 Beginners are often advised to avoid overcomplicating the practice with too many intellectual concepts and instead focus on their direct experience of the breath and body sensations.14 Finally, it is worth noting that concentration in this tradition is viewed as something that should be a pleasant and sustainable experience.16In conclusion, Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo's "Type 2" breath meditation technique is a distinctive and comprehensive method rooted in the rich tradition of Thai Forest Buddhism. It distinguishes itself through its active engagement with the breath, encouraging practitioners to adjust it for comfort and to intentionally direct the "breath sensation" as a form of energy through systematic body "scans." The step-by-step practice emphasizes the synchronization of breath with body awareness, utilizing the inhalation to guide the flow of sensation through specific pathways. With its potential benefits for physical and mental well-being, as well as its capacity to lead to deeper meditative states, "Type 2" meditation stands as a significant contribution to the landscape of Buddhist contemplative practices, offering a unique and potentially powerful approach to cultivating mindfulness, concentration, and insight.
