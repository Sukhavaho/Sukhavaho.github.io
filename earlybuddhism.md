# Unique Meditation Techniques in Early Buddhist Schools

#### First the Meditation Techniques
#### {Followed by the different schools}

The early Buddhist schools shared a common foundation of meditation practices derived from the Buddha's original teachings, but over time developed distinctive approaches and emphases. While the historical record is incomplete regarding all early schools' specific meditation techniques, we can identify some unique characteristics in the traditions for which information has survived.

## Pre-Sectarian Foundation

Before examining school-specific techniques, it's important to understand the shared foundation. Early Buddhist meditation included:

- The Four Foundations of Mindfulness (as described in the Satipatthana Sutta)
- The practice of jhāna/dhyāna (meditative absorptions)
- Preparatory practices including morality (sila), sense restraint, and right effort[2]

These core practices were interpreted and systematized differently as Buddhism developed into distinct schools.

## Theravada Distinctive Approaches

While modern Theravada preserves early Buddhist meditation techniques, its classical meditation manual, the 5th-century *Visuddhimagga* by Buddhaghoṣa, represents a significant development:

- Strong emphasis on **kasina meditation** (concentration on visual objects) as a central practice, which "departs from the Pali Canon, in which *dhyana* is the central meditative practice"[2]
- Systematization of forty meditation subjects, including:
  - Ten kasinas (earth, water, fire, air, blue, yellow, red, white, light, and "limited-space")
  - Ten kinds of foulness meditations
  - Ten recollections
  - Four divine abodes
  - Four immaterial states
  - One perception and one "defining"[2]

This elaborate system represents an evolution from earlier approaches, showing how the Theravada tradition developed its distinctive meditation framework.

## Sarvāstivāda Innovations

The Sarvāstivāda school, which was influential in North India and Central Asia before eventually disappearing, developed several unique meditation approaches:

- A personality-based system of five meditation techniques:
  1. Contemplation on the impure (*asubhabhavana*) for greedy personality types
  2. Meditation on loving kindness (*maitri*) for hateful types
  3. Contemplation on conditioned co-arising for deluded types
  4. Contemplation on the division of the dhatus for conceited types
  5. Mindfulness of breathing (*anapanasmrti*) for distracted types[2]

- A distinctive **sixfold breathing meditation** system that was particularly influential in East Asia:
  1. Counting breaths up to ten
  2. Following the breath through the body
  3. Fixing the mind on the breath
  4. Observing the breath at various locations
  5. Modifying (related to the four applications of mindfulness)
  6. Purifying (the arising of insight)[2]

- Special emphasis on contemplation of the impure and mindfulness of breathing as "gateways to immortality" (*amrta-dvāra*)[2]

This sixfold breathing system was later expanded upon by Chinese Tiantai master Zhiyi, showing its lasting influence in East Asian Buddhism.

## Yogācāra Practitioners

Within the Sarvāstivāda tradition, specialized meditation practitioners known as *yogācāras* developed approaches that were preserved in texts called *Dhyāna sutras* or "meditation summaries." These teachings focused on "concrete details of the meditative practice" and were influential in the development of both Mahayana meditation and possibly Yogacara philosophy[2].

## Legacy in Later Traditions

The search results indicate that "early Buddhist practice has been incorporated to greater and lesser degrees into the Tibetan Buddhism and the East Asian Mahayana Buddhism"[1]. The Sarvāstivāda approaches in particular had significant influence on Chinese Buddhism, with their sixfold breathing method being adapted and expanded in East Asian traditions[2].

## Conclusion

While information about specific meditation techniques for all early Buddhist schools remains incomplete, we can identify distinctive approaches in the Theravada and Sarvāstivāda traditions. The former developed an elaborate system centered on kasina meditation, while the latter created personality-based approaches and a unique sixfold breathing technique. These varying approaches demonstrate how meditation practice evolved as Buddhism spread and diversified across Asia.

### Early Schools of Buddhism: Development, Doctrines, and Legacy

The evolution of Buddhism from a unified movement into diverse schools represents one of the most fascinating chapters in religious history. Within a few centuries after the Buddha's passing, what began as a single community transformed into a rich tapestry of traditions with varying interpretations of the original teachings.

## Origins and Formation of Early Buddhist Schools

The earliest Buddhist community existed as a unified monastic organization for approximately a century after the Buddha's death (around 480 BCE). According to traditional accounts, the First Buddhist Council was convened shortly after the Buddha's passing, where senior disciples like Mahakasyapa, Ananda, and Upali recited and confirmed the Buddha's teachings and monastic rules[5]. While some historians question whether this council actually occurred as described, it represents the initial effort to preserve the Buddha's teachings through oral transmission.

The unified Buddhist community eventually split into multiple schools or "doctrinal schools" (Sanskrit: *vāda*). This process began with the division into two main monastic groups (Nikāyas):

1. **Sthaviranikāya** ("Elders")
2. **Mahāsāṃghika** ("Great Community")[1][3]

According to scholar Collett Cox, "most scholars would agree that even though the roots of the earliest recognized groups predate Aśoka, their actual separation did not occur until after his death"[1][3]. While Theravada tradition attributes this split to the Second Buddhist Council at Vaishali (approximately 100 years after the Buddha's death), historical evidence suggests the actual separation occurred later, during or after the reign of Emperor Ashoka (c. 268-232 BCE)[3].

These two initial schools further subdivided over time, eventually proliferating into what tradition numbers as 18 (or sometimes 20) different schools[1]. Some of the most significant included:

- **Sarvāstivāda** ("Temporal Eternalists")
- **Dharmaguptaka** ("Preservers of Dharma")
- **Mahīśāsaka**
- **Pudgalavāda** ("Personalists," also known as Vatsiputrīya and later Sammitīya)
- **Sautrāntika** (those who relied only on sutras)
- **Lokottaravāda** ("Transcendentalists")
- **Prajñaptivāda** ("Conceptualists")[1][3]

## Reasons for Diversification

The proliferation of Buddhist schools resulted from several interconnected factors:

### 1. Vinaya Disputes
The initial divisions primarily stemmed from disagreements over the monastic code of conduct (Vinaya)[1][3]. Different interpretations of rules for monks and nuns led to distinct practices among communities.

### 2. Geographical Separation
As Buddhism spread throughout the Indian subcontinent, physical distance between communities naturally led to divergent practices and interpretations[1][3]. This geographical separation reinforced existing differences and created new ones.

### 3. Doctrinal Disagreements
Over time, philosophical disagreements about the Buddha's teachings became increasingly important in defining school boundaries. By around 100 CE, schools could split based primarily on doctrinal differences rather than just Vinaya disputes[3].

### 4. Development of Abhidharma Literature
The various schools developed their own systematic philosophical texts (Abhidharma), which became sources of contention. As the search results note, "disputes between the schools were often based on these Abhidhammic writings"[3]. Interestingly, pre-sectarian Buddhism did not have fully developed Abhidharma scriptures.

### 5. Textual Interpretation
According to the scholar Gombrich, "unintentional literalism was a major force for change in the early doctrinal history of Buddhism"[3]. This involved paying excessive attention to precise wording rather than the intended meaning, leading to distinctions the Buddha may never have intended to make.

## Distinctive Ideas and Doctrines

Despite sharing a common foundation in the Buddha's teachings, the early schools developed unique philosophical perspectives:

### Sarvāstivāda
This influential school held that dharmas (phenomenal elements) exist in all three times—past, present, and future—hence their name, which means "everything exists"[3]. They were prominent in northwestern India and developed an extensive Abhidharma system that influenced later Mahayana thought.

### Pudgalavāda/Sammitīya
These "Personalists" proposed the concept of a "person" (pudgala) that was neither identical to nor different from the five aggregates. This was their solution to explaining rebirth and moral responsibility without a permanent self. Interestingly, during much of the early medieval period, this was numerically the largest Buddhist group in India[3].

### Sautrāntika
This school recognized only the authority of the sutras and rejected the Abhidharma texts accepted by schools like the Vaibhāṣika wing of Sarvāstivāda[3]. Their name literally means "those who rely on the sutras."

### Lokottaravāda
This Mahāsāṃghika subschool held that the Buddha was supramundane (lokottara) and that his physical manifestation was merely an apparition for the benefit of sentient beings.

### Theravāda (Sthaviravāda)
This tradition, which survives today, developed its own distinctive Abhidharma philosophy. Its canonical Abhidhamma Pitaka "has little in common with the Abhidhamma works recognized by other Buddhist schools"[3].

## Early Buddhist Meditation Practices

While the search results provide limited information about school-specific meditation techniques, they do mention core practices from early Buddhism:

Early Buddhist meditation was significantly shaped by ascetic traditions prevalent in ancient India. The Buddha himself experimented with numerous ascetic practices before discovering the Middle Way, which emphasized balance rather than extreme self-denial[2].

Central techniques included:
- **Breath awareness**
- **Mindfulness practice**

The Satipatthana Sutta, a key text in the Pali Canon, outlines the Four Foundations of Mindfulness:
1. Mindfulness of the body
2. Mindfulness of feelings
3. Mindfulness of mind
4. Mindfulness of mental objects (dhammas)

This approach emphasizes "observing one's thoughts, sensations, and emotions in a non-judgmental way, fostering a deep understanding of the nature of reality"[2]. By cultivating awareness through mindfulness, practitioners could develop insight into the nature of existence.

## Influences On Early Buddhist Schools

The development of early Buddhist schools was shaped by several influences:

1. **Ascetic traditions**: Early Buddhist meditation practices were influenced by the ascetic traditions common in ancient India[2].

2. **Oral tradition methodology**: The preservation of Buddhist teachings through memorization and chanting drew on precedents from Vedic traditions, where texts had been orally transmitted for centuries[5].

3. **Indigenous philosophical systems**: As Buddhism spread across India, it encountered and responded to various philosophical systems.

## Legacy and Influence

The early Buddhist schools played a crucial role in the development of later Buddhist traditions:

1. **Foundation for Mahayana**: "Early Mahayana came directly from 'early Buddhist schools' and was a successor to them"[3]. Specifically, the Sarvāstivādin school "provided some of the doctrines that would later be adopted by the Mahāyāna"[3].

2. **Preservation of diverse perspectives**: Later Mahayana schools may have preserved ideas abandoned by Theravada, such as "the Three Bodies doctrine, the idea of consciousness (vijnana) as a continuum, and devotional elements such as the worship of saints"[3].

3. **Textual legacy**: While most early schools eventually disappeared, their texts often survived in translation, particularly in Chinese. These texts provide valuable insights into the diversity of early Buddhist thought.

## Comparison with Modern Theravada

Modern Theravada Buddhism represents the only surviving school from this early period. However, it differs in several ways from its early counterparts:

1. **Historical development**: The term 'Theravada' was not used before the fourth century CE, though its textual foundation (the Pali Canon) was first committed to writing around 50 BCE[3].

2. **Geographical focus**: While early Buddhist schools were spread across the Indian subcontinent, modern Theravada is primarily established in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.

3. **Canonical differences**: Theravada preserved its own unique Abhidhamma texts that differ significantly from those of other early schools. Its approach to the Vinaya and Sutta collections also developed distinctive features over time.

4. **Modern adaptations**: Contemporary Theravada has incorporated various reforms and adaptations over centuries that distinguish it from its ancient predecessors.

## Conclusion

The development of early Buddhist schools represents a fascinating process of doctrinal elaboration and adaptation. What began as disagreements over monastic discipline evolved into a rich diversity of philosophical perspectives, all claiming to represent the Buddha's authentic teachings. 

While most of these schools eventually disappeared (with Theravada being the notable exception), their ideas continued to influence the development of Buddhism throughout Asia. The textual legacy of these schools provides valuable insights into how Buddhist thought evolved in its formative centuries and how a single religious founder's teachings could generate such remarkable philosophical diversity.

Though information about specific meditation practices and detailed doctrines of each school remains somewhat limited in the available sources, the general pattern of development shows Buddhism's remarkable ability to adapt and diversify while maintaining core principles from the Buddha's original teachings.
